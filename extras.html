	<p>I did some cooking outside of school which I really enjoy. I have been cooking for many years so it's always fun when I have time to took. I usually cook Mexican or Thai food because those are what I am best at but sometimes I make Mediterranean.</p>
           

    <p>I also hung out with my dog, Maddie a lot during my free time. I like to go on walks and car rides with her. We usually go to Point Isabel which is a walikg path by the water for dogs or we walk around Target.</p>
